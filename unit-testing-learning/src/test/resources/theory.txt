Introduction

Software testing ensures that our Java code behaves as expected, remains maintainable, and can evolve safely.

Why testing matters:
	â€¢	Detects defects early in development
	â€¢	Prevents regressions when refactoring
	â€¢	Builds developer confidence
	â€¢	Improves design and documentation

Testing is most effective when it follows a structured approach, guided by the Testing Pyramid and consistent test design patterns.



The Testing Pyramid Concept

The Testing Pyramid illustrates the balance between types of automated tests:
	â€¢	Unit Tests â†’ small, fast, and numerous
	â€¢	Integration Tests â†’ connect components together
	â€¢	End-to-End Tests â†’ verify the full system behavior

Goal: find the right balance between speed, coverage, and reliability.

The higher you go up the pyramid, the slower and more expensive tests become.

Overview of Testing Layers

Unit Tests
Verify single methods or classes
Small
Very fast
JUnit, Mockito, AssertJ
Integration Tests
Check module interaction
Medium
Moderate
Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers, REST Assured
E2E Tests
Validate the entire system flow
Large
Slow
Selenium, Playwright, REST Assured

Each layer complements the others â€” together, they provide full confidence in the system.



Unit Testing

Definition:
Unit tests verify the smallest testable parts of your code â€” usually one class or one function.

Why it matters:
	â€¢	Early detection of logic errors
	â€¢	Encourages clean, modular design
	â€¢	Enables refactoring with confidence

Common frameworks:
	â€¢	JUnit 5 â€” Java testing standard
	â€¢	Mockito â€” mocking dependencies
	â€¢	AssertJ / Hamcrest â€” expressive assertions

Best practices:
	â€¢	Test one behavior per test method
	â€¢	Avoid external dependencies (network, DB, filesystem)
	â€¢	Use mocks and stubs for isolation
	â€¢	Keep tests fast and deterministic



Test Structure and Patterns

To make tests clear and readable, follow standard test design patterns.

ðŸ§© 1. Arrangeâ€“Actâ€“Assert (AAA)

This is the most common structure for a test method:
	1.	Arrange â€“ set up data, mocks, and environment
	2.	Act â€“ execute the method or action under test
	3.	Assert â€“ verify that the outcome matches expectations

Example

âœ… Why it helps:
	â€¢	Improves readability and consistency
	â€¢	Makes intent of each test clear
	â€¢	Easier debugging when something fails


ðŸ§© 2. Givenâ€“Whenâ€“Then

Originating from BDD, but also useful in standard tests:
	â€¢	Given â€“ the initial context (setup)
	â€¢	When â€“ the action or event
	â€¢	Then â€“ the expected result

Example

âœ… Why it helps:
	â€¢	Focuses on behavior, not implementation
	â€¢	Easier for non-developers to understand
	â€¢	Aligns perfectly with BDD practices

ðŸ§© 3. Four-Phase Test Pattern

A variation of AAA used in many testing frameworks:
	1.	Setup â€“ prepare objects and environment
	2.	Exercise â€“ run the code under test
	3.	Verify â€“ check outcomes
	4.	Teardown â€“ clean up (close DB, clear mocks, etc.)

âœ… Why it helps:
	â€¢	Especially useful for integration and E2E tests
	â€¢	Keeps resource management organized



Integration Testing

Definition:
Integration tests verify that different parts of your system work together properly.

Typical use cases:
	â€¢	Repository + database interaction
	â€¢	Controller + service + repository layers
	â€¢	Communication between microservices

Java tools:
	â€¢	Spring Boot Test: runs full or partial application contexts
	â€¢	Testcontainers: spins up real dependencies like databases in Docker
	â€¢	REST Assured: sends real HTTP requests to your APIs

Best practices:
	â€¢	Use lightweight databases (like H2) or Dockerized ones
	â€¢	Reset the state after each test
	â€¢	Avoid dependencies between test cases



End-to-End (E2E) Testing

Definition:
E2E tests verify the complete user journey across all layers (frontend, backend, database).

Examples:
	â€¢	Logging in and viewing a dashboard
	â€¢	Submitting a form and verifying the result in the database
	â€¢	Full API flow validation

Tools:
	â€¢	Selenium WebDriver â€“ browser automation
	â€¢	Playwright / Cypress â€“ modern frameworks for fast and reliable testing
	â€¢	REST Assured â€“ API-level E2E validation

Challenges:
	â€¢	Slower execution
	â€¢	Harder to maintain when UI or APIs change

Best practice:

Keep E2E tests minimal â€” only cover the most critical paths.

Slide 9 â€“ Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Definition:
A development practice where tests are written before the implementation code.

Cycle (Redâ€“Greenâ€“Refactor):
	1.	Red: Write a failing test (feature not yet implemented)
	2.	Green: Write minimal code to make the test pass
	3.	Refactor: Improve the code while keeping tests green

Why TDD matters for juniors:
	â€¢	Forces you to think about expected behavior first
	â€¢	Leads to cleaner, modular, testable design
	â€¢	Provides a safety net for future changes

Java tools:
JUnit 5 + Mockito + IDE integration (IntelliJ, Eclipse)



Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

Definition:
BDD extends TDD by describing behavior in a natural, human-readable language, promoting collaboration between developers, testers, and business people.

Structure:

Example (Gherkin + Cucumber):

Tools:
	â€¢	Cucumber (Java) â€“ executes Gherkin scenarios
	â€¢	JUnit Integration â€“ runs Cucumber tests
	â€¢	Spring Boot + Cucumber â€“ integration for real-world apps

Benefits:
	â€¢	Common language across roles
	â€¢	Living documentation
	â€¢	Helps identify missing requirements



Continuous Testing & CI/CD

Continuous testing integrates automated testing into your build and deployment pipelines.

Pipeline example:
	1.	Build project
	2.	Run unit tests
	3.	Run integration tests (Testcontainers, Spring Boot)
	4.	Run E2E tests (Selenium, Playwright)
	5.	Generate reports and coverage

Tools:
	â€¢	Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
	â€¢	JaCoCo (coverage), Surefire (reports), Allure (dashboards)

Goal:

Detect problems as early as possible and deliver reliable software continuously.



Best Practices
	â€¢	Follow the Testing Pyramid balance
	â€¢	Use Arrangeâ€“Actâ€“Assert for consistent test structure
	â€¢	Write clear, behavior-focused tests
	â€¢	Keep tests fast, independent, repeatable
	â€¢	Avoid fragile tests that depend on environment or order
	â€¢	Maintain test code quality â€” itâ€™s production code too
	â€¢	Automate everything in CI/CD



Summary & Key Takeaways
	â€¢	The Testing Pyramid ensures efficiency and structure
	â€¢	Unit, Integration, and E2E tests target different levels of risk
	â€¢	TDD improves design quality
	â€¢	BDD improves communication and understanding
	â€¢	AAA and Givenâ€“Whenâ€“Then make tests readable and consistent
	â€¢	Continuous testing builds confidence in your Java projects
